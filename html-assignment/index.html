                <!--About me part one (min 50 words)-->
                I was born in <strong>Nottingham, England</strong> on the 15<sup>th</sup> of November, 1996 and immigrated to <strong>Canada</strong> with my family sometime in 1998.
                <br> I went to <strong><abbr title="South Carleton High School">SCHS</abbr></strong> and graduated in 2014 with an <strong><abbr title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</abbr> <abbr title="Specialist High Skills Major">SHSM</abbr></strong> diploma.
                <br> I studied <strong>Animation</strong> at <strong>Algonquin</strong> from September 2014 until December 2019 after dropping out of first year once and failing second year twice.

                I love <strong>drawing</strong> and <strong>animating</strong>. I also enjoy playing <strong>video games</strong> and listening to <strong>music</strong>.
                <br> I live with my <strong>twin sister</strong> in a house previously owned by our late father in <strong>Kanata</strong>. 
                <br> We own a fat, cream and white male cat we named <strong>Smough</strong> that we adopted from the <strong><abbr title="Ottawa Humane Society">OHS</abbr></strong> in January.
