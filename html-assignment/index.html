            </h2>
            <p>
                <!--About me part one (min 50 words)-->
                I was born in Nottingham, England on the 15<sup>th</sup> of November, 1996 and immigrated to Canada with my family in 1998.
                <br> I went to <abbr title="South Carleton High School">SCHS</abbr> and graduated in 2014 with an <abbr title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</abbr> <abbr title="Specialist High Skills Major">SHSM</abbr> diploma.
                <br> I studied Animation at Algonquin from September 2014 until December 2019 after dropping out of first year once and failing second year twice.
                <br> I currently live with my twin sister in a house previously owned by our late father in Kanata.

                I love drawing and animating. I also enjoy playing video games and listening to music.

                    <li>Gorillaz</li>
                </ul>
                These are my favourite video games:
