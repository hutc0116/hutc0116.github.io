            <!--About Me part one-->
            <p>
                I was born in Nottingham, England on the 15<sup>th</sup> of November, 1996 and immigrated to Canada with my family in 1998.
                <br> I went to <abbr title="South Carleton High School">SCHS</abbr> and graduated in 2014 with an <abbr title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</abbr> <abbr title="Specialist High Skills Major">SHSM</abbr> diploma.
                <br> I studied Animation at Algonquin from September 2014 until December 2019 after dropping out of first year once and failing second year twice.
                <br> I currently live with my twin sister in a house previously owned by our late father in Kanata. 
            </p>
            <!--About Me part two-->
            <p>
                I was recommended this program by a friend who'd graduated from it earlier this year, and I decided to enroll because this program seemed to blend creative and technical work together in a way that interested me. 
                <br>I hope that I can graduate from this program and be able to secure a job using the skills I've learned during my time here.
            </p>
            <!--About Me part three-->
            <p>
                I love drawing and animating. I also enjoy playing video games and listening to music. Art is important to me and a lot of my hobbies and interests revolve around it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of my favourite video games are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Silent Hill 2</li>
                <li>Elden Ring</li>
                <li>Team Fortress 2</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                And here's my top three bands:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Radiohead</li>
                <li>Queens of the Stone Age</li>
                <li>Gorillaz</li>
            </ol>

                    Me and my sister own a cat that we adopted from the <abbr title="Ottawa Humane Society">OHS</abbr> in January. 
                    <br> He was very fat when we got him, and he's still pretty fat now, but he has lost a bit of weight thanks to the diet we have him on.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    A little info about him:
